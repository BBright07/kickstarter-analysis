# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This analysis helped Louisa get an overview of media campaign outcomes, as well as related fundraiding efforts over time.  

### Purpose
With this analysis Louisa can find out which events were successful, canceled, or failed along with details on whether funding goals were met, unmet, or exceeded. 

## Analysis and Challenges
To perform this analysis I created two pivot tables and their charts to provide Louisa with essential information that was categorized according to outcomes. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis of OUTCOMES BADED ON LAUNCH DATE was designed to show the count of failed, successful, and canceled outcomes by month for all years. This was designed to let Louisa get a big picture of the extent of succeses as well as opportunities for growth.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-       #

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
